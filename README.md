# RTOS_Temperature_Control
This project involved the development ofa system with the TM4C123GH6PM microcontroller to implement a temperature control system with hardware.
The peripherals that were used were: ADC, UART and GPIO. An LCD driver was needed to display the readings on a 16*2 LCD screan.
The hardware used was an LCD, Fan, simple heater as well as a relay to acuate the heater.
